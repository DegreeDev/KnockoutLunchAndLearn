<h2>The Binding Context</h2>
<p>When applying the bindings ( and in knockout in general )  you are using the element not the jQuery selector</p>
<p>Bindings should be the last thing you do. All of the object that you need should already be on the page and ready to be set up. </p>

<pre>
ko.applyBindings(new ViewModel());                  //Generic
ko.applyBindings(new ViewModel(), $("#id").get(0)); //Specific(Slower)
ko.applyBindings(new ViewModel(), $("#id")[0]);     //Specifc (Faster)
</pre>

<p>
    This applys bindings to the entire page. In general I suggest not using this becuase it limits the use of knockout for other people who may live on your page. 
    An example of this in SPP is that we have a "Notification Center" which is bound with knockout. This appears on multiple pages. If an ko app binds to the entire page
    this Notification center cannot do it's binding. 
</p>


<pre>
ko.applyBindings(new ViewModel(), $("#my-element")[0]);
ko.applyBindings(new ViewModel(), $("#notification-center")[0]);
< div id="notification-center">< /div>
< div id="my-element">< /div>

</pre>

<p>
    This allows both ko contexts to live on the same page and not conflict with each other.
